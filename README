## how small can an npm package be?

### Rules

* `npm publish --dry-run` should succeed
* `npm pack && gzip -l  pkg-size-golf-0.0.0.tgz` will show the compressed size
* some discount/leeway for the fact that the smallest name that exist will be taken
* no requirements for npm/node version as long as it is publishable
